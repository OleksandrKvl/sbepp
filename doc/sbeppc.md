# Using the schema compiler {#sbeppc}

Usage:

```
sbeppc [OPTIONS]... FILE

Options:
    --schema-name NAME  override schema name. Uses `messageSchema.package` by
                        default
    --output-dir DIR    output directory. Uses current directory by default
    --version           print version and exit
    --help              print this help and exit
    --                  end of optional arguments
```

Here's an example of the resulting file structure:

```bash
output_dir/schema_name/         # `schema_name` directory is generated by sbeppc
    schema_name.hpp             # contains everything

    schema/
        schema.hpp              # contains tags

    types/                      # contains public types
        type_a.hpp              # file per type
        type_b.hpp
        # ...

    messages/                   # contains messages
        message_a.hpp           # file per message
        message_b.hpp
        # ...
```

Here, `schema`, `types` and `messages` are hardcoded names, files for
type/message will have the same name as their corresponding entity in XML
schema.  
Each of those headers includes its type dependencies so usually one needs to
include only the message-related headers.

\note Existing files are always overwritten.

In the description above, `schema_name` is by default taken from
`messageSchema.package` attribute. This name is also used for a top-level
namespace name and thus should follow C++ naming rules. However, SBE
requirements for `messageSchema.package` are much weaker, actually, this
attribute is optional. For cases when default name is not valid/desired, there's
a `--schema-name` option to specify/override schema name.

\note `sbeppc` is not a reference SBE schema validation tool. It implements the
standard only to extent required for correct data representation. It does its
best but please don't rely on it for complete schema validation.
