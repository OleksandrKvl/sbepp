# Schema representation {#representation}
[TOC]

In this section I'll try to gradually describe the structure of generated code.
It's just a brief description, for detailed documentation see corresponding
reference pages.

---

## Namespaces

Here's the structure of generated code after [compilation](#sbeppc):

```cpp
namespace schema_name{
    struct schema{ // see "Traits" section
        struct types;
        struct messages;
    };

    namespace messages{
        // messages are here...
        class message_name;
    }

    namespace types{
        // types are here...
        class type_name;
    }

    namespace detail{} // implementation details, never use it directly
}
```

Here, `detail`, `schema`, `messages` and `types` are hardcoded and don't depend
on schema names.

---

## Schema names

`sbepp` preserves names of all schema entities without any modification. It
means that messages, types, fields, etc. will have the same type/function names
in the generated code. Of course standard
C++ naming rules are still applied and usually you'll get an error from `sbeppc`
if schema uses wrong name.

---

## Semantics

Most types generated by `sbepp` have *reference semantics*. It means they are
just pointers to the actual data which they don't own and don't manage in any
way.

\note It's client's responsibility to manage the lifetime and size of the
underlying buffer.

They usually contain a single pointer (with one additional pointer in Debug mode)
and
are cheap to pass by value. Creation of such an object usually invloves no
actions/parsing except the pointer intialization. They are templates with `Byte`
template
parameter which is a byte type (can be cv-qualified). Another consequence of
reference semantics is that making object `const` doesn't make underlying data
`const`, i.e., you can modify a message via `const msg<char>` object. You need
to use `const`-qualified `Byte` type to make a thing read-only.  
There are helpers to access raw underlying data which are available for all
reference semantics types: `sbepp::size_bytes`, `sbepp::size_bytes_checked`,
`sbepp::addressof`.

[Non-array types](#non-array-types), [enums](#enums) and [sets](#sets) are the
only schema entities represented with *value semantics* types (including
[constants](#constants)). They are small, 64 bits at most, types which behave
like `int`.

### Safety checks

As was said before, client is responsible to ensure that provided buffer is
enough to hold corresponding SBE data. To provide some sort of safety, `sbepp`
inserts assertions in many places. They check only the accessed data, not the whole
SBE message or other entity. For example, if a message has 10 fields and
provided buffer can only hold 5 of them, you'll get an assertion only when any
of last 5 fields will be accessed. By default, these checks are controlled by
`NDEBUG` just as standard `assert()`.

\see #SBEPP_DISABLE_ASSERTS, #SBEPP_ASSERT_HANDLER,
#SBEPP_ENABLE_ASSERTS_WITH_HANDLER

### Encoding vs. decoding

`sbepp` doesn't make a distinction between encoding and decoding. It only
provides SBE view of the provided buffer. Functions have no hidden side-effects
beyond their main functionality. The only thing which is done implicitly is
handling of SBE schema extension mechanism by respecting `blockLength`. This has
several consequences. First, be
careful not to change things which affect the offset of the following
already-written fields. For example, if you have dynamic-length fields `data1`
and `data2`, don't change `data1`'s size after you filled `data2` because its
offset the data will become a garbage. Simple advice is to fill
groups/data fields in-order.
Second, when you encode a new message, you need to explicitly fill message/group
header via `sbepp::fill_message_header` or `sbepp::fill_group_header` and it's
better to do this as early as possible.

---

## Messages {#messages}

Messages and [composites](#composites) are two root things from which any work
with SBE data starts. Like any reference semantics type, they are created from
pointer and size:

```cpp
// check out base class documentation for more constructors
template<typename Byte>
class msg : ::sbepp::detail::message_base<Byte>{
public:
    // field accessors...
};

std::array<std::byte, 64> buf;
schema_name::messages::msg<std::byte> m{buf.data(), buf.size()};
```

There is a couple of helpers which deduce byte type for you,
`sbepp::make_view` and `sbepp::make_const_view`. They are applicable to any
reference semantics type except group entry.

```cpp
std::array<std::byte, 64> buf;

// mutable message
auto m1 = sbepp::make_view<schema_name::messages::msg>(buf.data(), buf.size());
// read-only message
auto m2 =
    sbepp::make_const_view<schema_name::messages::msg>(buf.data(), buf.size());
```

The main purpose of messages, composites and group entries is of course to
contain fields, their interface will be discussed later in the
[accessors](#accessors) section.

### Encoding {#encoding-message}

Since `sbepp` provides only a message's view, message header should be filled
explicitly via `sbepp::fill_message_header` when a new message is created:

```cpp
std::array<std::byte, 64> buf;
auto m = sbepp::make_view<schema_name::messages::msg>(buf.data(), buf.size());
sbepp::fill_message_header(m);
```

\note It's strongly recommended to fill message header as early as possible
because its `blockLength` is required to correctly interpret underlying data.

You can also fill it by hand using `sbepp::get_header`:

```cpp
std::array<std::byte, 64> buf;
auto m = sbepp::make_view<schema_name::messages::msg>(buf.data(), buf.size());
auto header = sbepp::get_header(m);
header.blockLength(10);
// ...
```

---

## Composites {#composites}

Typically, you need first to create a message header to check the type of the
incoming message. Composite has the same form and construction approach as
[message](#messages):

```cpp
template<typename Byte>
class messageHeader : ::sbepp::detail::composite_base<Byte>{
public:
    // field accessors...
};

std::array<char, 64> buf;
auto header = sbepp::make_view<schema_name::types::messageHeader>(
    buf.data(), buf.size());
if(header.templateId()
    == sbepp::message_traits<schema_name::schema::messages::msg1>::id())
{
    // handle msg1
}
```

---

## Groups {#groups}

In general, group has a container-like interface with iterators and other
members you'd expect from standard container. There are two kinds of groups
(message levels in general sense)
which provide different interfaces:
1. Flat - a group which has only a fixed-size fields, no groups or data
    members. Such a group is represented like a random-access container similar
    to `std::vector`. See `sbepp::detail::flat_group_base` for complete
    reference.
2. Nested - a group with has other groups or data members. Due to its nature,
    it's represented as a forward-only container (it's very expensive to
    navigate over it in a random fashion). See
    `sbepp::detail::nested_group_base` for complete reference.

### Encoding

Because `sbepp` provides only views, there are no functions like `push_back`,
there's nothing to push. To encode a group, one needs first to set its size,
then access corresponding group entries. Similar to
[message header](#encoding-message), group header has to filled explicitly either
by `sbepp::fill_group_header`, `resize()` method or manually by
`sbepp::get_header`:

```cpp
auto g = msg.group_name();

// set group size
auto group_size = 2;
sbepp::fill_group_header(g, group_size);

// fill entries
for(const auto entry : g)
{
    entry.field(1);
}

// change size later if you need
g.clear();
g.resize(1);
```

\note As for [message header](#encoding-message), group header has to be filled
as early as possible because its `numInGroup` and `blockLength` are used to
correctly interpret the underlying data.

### Group entries

Group entries have no special properties and normally are never created
explicitly. See `sbepp::detail::entry_base` for details if you are interested.

```cpp
template<typename Byte>
class entry : public sbepp::detail::entry_base<Byte>{
public:
    // field accessors...
};
```

---

## Data members

Variable-length arrays are represented using `sbepp::detail::dynamic_array_ref`.
This type works like a reference to a vector-like type.

```cpp
auto d = msg.data();

if(!d.empty())
{
    std::cout.write(d.data(), d.size());
}

d.clear();
const char str[]={"hi"};
d.assign(std::begin(str), std::end(str));
```

---

## Fixed-size arrays

`sbepp` treats all `<type>`s with `length != 1` (including `0`) as fixed-size
arrays. They are implemented in terms of `sbepp::detail::static_array_ref` which
has `std::span`-like interface.

```cpp
auto array = msg.array();

std::cout.write(array.data(), array.size());
```

---

## Optional/required types {#non-array-types}

See `sbepp::char_t` and `sbepp::char_opt_t` for the example of required and
optional type correspondingly.

\note While optional/required types provide methods like
`sbepp::detail::required_base::in_range()` and
`sbepp::detail::optional_base::has_value()`, they don't enforce any checks on
the underlying value.

---

## Enums {#enums}

Enums are represented using scoped enumerations. For example:

```xml
<enum name="enumeration" encodingType="uint8">
    <validValue name="One">1</validValue>
    <validValue name="Two">2</validValue>
</enum>
```

is represented like:

```cpp
enum class enumeration : std::uint8_t
{
    One : 1,
    Two : 2
};
```

\see `sbepp::to_underlying`, `sbepp::enum_to_string`

---

## Sets {#sets}

In set representation, each `choice` has a corresponding getter and setter, for
example:

```xml
<set name="bitset" encodingType="uint8">
    <choice name="A">0</choice>
    <choice name="B">2</choice>
</set>
```

is represented like:

```cpp
class bitset : public ::sbepp::detail::bitset_base<::std::uint8_t>
{
public:
    // check out base class documentation for inherited methods
    using ::sbepp::detail::bitset_base<::std::uint8_t>::bitset_base;

    // pair of getter and setter for each choice
    constexpr bool A() const noexcept;
    bitset& A(const bool v) noexcept;

    constexpr bool B() const noexcept;
    bitset& B(const bool v) noexcept;
};
```

\warning It's important to remember that sets have value semantics to avoid such
mistakes:

```cpp
// writing a message
schema_name::messages::msg<char> m; // initialize somehow
// does nothing!!! modifies a temporary returned by `m.bitset()`
m.bitset().A(true).B(true);
// also does nothing, assigns to a  temporary `bool`
m.bitset().A() = true;

// correct way
m.bitset(schema_name::types::bitset{}.A(true).B(true));
// or, if storage was 0-initialized
m.bitset(m.bitset().A(true).B(true));
```

\see `sbepp::visit_set`

---

## Constants {#constants}

Constant accessors are represented via `static` functions. Non-array constants
return directly underlying value without any wrapper. Only `<field>` can return
it as enum type. Array-like constants (strings) are represented using
`sbepp::detail::static_array_ref` like a fixed-size array.

```xml
<composite name="constants">
    <type name="num_const" primitiveType="uint32"
        presence="constant">123</type>
    <type name="str_const" primitiveType="char"
        presence="constant">hello world</type>
</composite>

<sbe:message name="message" id="1">
    <field name="enum_const" id="1" type="enumeration"
        presence="constant" valueRef="enumeration.Two"/>
</sbe:message>
```

```cpp
// somewhere inside `constants` class
static constexpr ::std::uint32_t num_const() noexcept;
static constexpr implementation_defined_alias str_const() noexcept;

// somewhere inside `message` class
static constexpr schema_name::types::enumeration enum_const() noexcept;
```

---

## Field accessors {#accessors}

There are multiple entities which can hold fields: messages, group entries and
composites. They all provide the same interface for accessors:

```cpp
template<typename Byte>
class FieldContainer
{
public:
    FieldRepresentation value_semantics_field();
    void value_semantics_field(FieldRepresentation);

    View<Byte> reference_semantics_field();
};
```

That is, for value semantics fields there are pair of getter and setter, for
reference semantics fields there is only a getter which returns a view with the
same byte type as its enclosing object. When byte type is `const`-qualified,
setters are not available.  
Unlike [cursor-based accessors](#cursor-accessors), these "normal" accessors can
be used in any order.

```cpp
schema_name::messages::msg<char> m; // init somehow

// value semantics types
auto required = m.required();
m.required(1);

auto optional = m.optional();
m.optional(2);

auto enumeration = m.enumeration();
m.enumeration(schema_name::types::my_enum::A);

auto set = m.set();
m.set(schema_name::types::my_set{}.choice(true));

// reference semantics types, they all have byte type `char`
auto c1 = m.composite();
auto c2 = m.composite().nested_composite();
auto g = m.group();
auto d = m.data();
```

---

## Cursor-based accessors {#cursor-accessors}

\note The API described in this section makes sense to use only for messages
of a complex structure. I recommend always to do benchmarks before using it.

While [normal accessors](#accessors) can be used in any order, this is not
always efficient. Consider this message:

```xml
<sbe:message name="nested_msg" id="1">
    <field name="field1" id="1" type="uint32"/>
    <field name="field2" id="2" type="uint32"/>
    <field name="field3" id="3" type="uint32"/>

    <group name="group" id="2">
        <field name="number" id="1" type="uint32"/>
        <data name="data3" id="2" type="varDataEncoding"/>
    </group>

    <data name="data1" id="3" type="varDataEncoding"/>
    <data name="data2" id="4" type="varDataEncoding"/>
</sbe:message>
```

Here, access to `field1/2/3` is still fast but access to the `data1`
is not. To get its offset we need:
- read `blockLength` from `nested_msg` header to get `group`'s offset
- read `numInGroup` from `group` header
- read `blockLength` from `group` header
- for each `group` entry
    + use `blockLength` to get offset to `data2`
    + read `data2` length
- finally, get `data1` offset

Moreover, to access next `data2` all that work has to be repeated!
Now imagine if there were more groups and data in that message.
It's a lot of work and
current compilers can't optimize
[normal accessors](#accessors) well even when everything is accessed in order.

The way to solve it is to access things in a forward-only manner to avoid
recalculation of the next field's offset each time from the message start. In
this way, after we've read the `group`, offset for `data1` is ready for free.
This is the core idea behind cursor-based API.

\note Cursor-based API is used for forward-only access

A cursor (`sbepp::cursor<Byte>`) is just a pointer wrapper which is passed to
field accessors as an additional parameter:

```cpp
template<typename Byte>
class FieldContainer
{
public:
    template<typename Cursor>
    FieldRepresentation value_semantics_field(Cursor&&);
    template<typename Cursor>
    void value_semantics_field(FieldRepresentation, Cursor&&);

    template<typename Cursor>
    View<Byte> reference_semantics_field(Cursor&&);
};
```

It's parameterized with `Byte` type which has the same meaning as for other
reference semantics types. Note that it can be more `const`-qualified than the
byte type of an enclosing view, setters are not available for such cursors.

By default, each field assumes that cursor points to the end of the previous
field (or to the end of group/message header) so the offset to current field can
be calculated efficiently (usually a no-op), then cursor is advanced using these
rules:
- `field` moves cursor up by field's size
- last `field` moves cursor to the end of the block (calculated using `blockLength`)
- first variable length member (`group` or `data`) of the message/entry unconditionally
    initializes cursor to the end of the block before using it. It means that
    it's possible to use uninitialized cursor with them but I don't recommend it
- `group` moves cursor to the end of group's header
- `data` moves cursor to the end of the data (`data() + size()`)

Cursor has to be initialized before the first usage, it can be done via
`sbepp::init_cursor`/`sbepp::init_const_cursor` or by using
`sbepp::cursor_ops::init` or even by hand from provided pointer. Only messages
and group entries provide cursor-based
accessors (composites cannot contain variable-sized fields). Note that
cursor-based and normal accessors return the same objects. Those object don't
care how they were created.  
Here's an example of how to read the above message:

```cpp
auto m = sbepp::make_view<nested_msg>(buf.data(), buf.size());
auto c = sbepp::init_cursor(m);

m.field1(c);
m.field2(c);
m.field3(c);

for(const auto entry : m.group(c).cursor_range(c))
{
    entry.number(c);
    entry.data3(c);
}

m.data1(c);
m.data2(c);
```

Note that you need to use `cursor_range()` to iterate over group entries. That's
because now each entry is created from the cursor.

Here's how compiler will see it (simplified of course):

```cpp
char* ptr = msg_start;
auto field1 = *reinterpret_cast<field1_type*>(ptr);
ptr += sizeof(field1);
auto field2 = *reinterpret_cast<field2_type*>(ptr);
ptr += sizeof(field2);
// ...
```

This approach is very efficient but the downside is that to access a field, you
need to access all previous fields in their schema order.  
To provide some sort of flexibility, there are various `sbepp::cursor_ops`
helpers which can control cursor's position. Check out their documentation for
examples. Here, I only want to duplicate one tricky case from
`sbepp::cursor_ops::dont_move`, using cursor to write a data member:

```cpp
auto c = sbepp::init_cursor(msg);
auto d = msg.data(sbepp::cursor_ops::dont_move(c));
d.resize(1);   // set data size somehow
msg.data(c);   // advance the cursor
```

Recall that `data` accessors by-default move the cursor to `data() + size()` so
when done in a naive way:

```cpp
auto d = msg.data(c);
d.resize(1);
```

at the time we access `data`, its length can have any value (your best
hope is message buffer initialized by `0`), thus, cursor will be moved to the
unknown position and its furher use is unpredictable or even UB.

As you can see, using cursor-based API might be tricky and requires
additional care. Most schemas I saw have only a single flat group and no data,
for them normal accessors work great.
I recommend to use cursors only for messages with complex
structure or when you did a benchmark and know for sure that you'll benefit from
it.
